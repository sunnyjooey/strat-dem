"Introduction
","The chapter from the book ""Strategies for Democracy"" focuses on the historical and contemporary challenges faced by the Progressive movement in combating systemic corruption and plutocracy in the United States. It begins by tracing the origins and objectives of the Progressive movement, which emerged during the first Gilded Age as a response to the undemocratic effects of concentrated wealth and corporate power. The movement successfully implemented strategies such as direct democracy and anti-corruption reforms, empowering majoritarian reforms like those seen during the New Deal.

The chapter highlights the lack of competent progressive strategy in recent generations, leading to the erosion of democracy into a corrupt plutocracy, with hints of totalitarianism since 2016. The author argues that without solving their strategic deficits, progressives may fail to reclaim democracy and avoid further authoritarian shifts.

A central theme is the manipulation of anti-corruption rhetoric by various political figures, including Donald Trump, who promised to ""drain the swamp"" but instead reinforced systemic corruption through his Supreme Court appointments. The chapter delves into the distinction between individual and systemic corruption, criticizing the judicial interpretations that have legalized plutocratic influence in politics under the guise of protecting free speech.

The Supreme Court, particularly through its rulings since Buckley v. Valeo (1976), has been identified as a pivotal player in entrenching systemic corruption by equating money with free speech. This judicial endorsement of corruption has thwarted democratic principles, contrary to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.

The chapter calls for a strategic mobilization against this judicial supremacy and systemic corruption, advocating for reforms to reclaim democracy. It stresses the importance of understanding and utilizing the Constitution's foundational principles, including separation of powers and federalism, to combat modern plutocratic rule.

The author critiques the influence of moneyed interests and identity politics, arguing for a unifying strategy that transcends fragmented identity politics and restores the egalitarian democratic identity central to American values. The chapter concludes by urging progressives to learn from historical successes and craft a coherent, strategic approach to counteract the entrenched plutocracy and judicial supremacy undermining democracy in the United States."
"Chapter 1. The Political Wilderness of Plutocratic Corruption
","Chapter 1, titled ""The Political Wilderness of Plutocratic Corruption,"" explores the evolution and entrenchment of plutocratic corruption in the United States and its ramifications on democracy both domestically and globally. The chapter begins by contextualizing the disillusionment prevalent in American politics, as articulated by George Kennan, who compared the country’s political trajectory to that of a historically vulnerable Russia, and Henry Blodgett, who warned of the emergence of a plutocratic society dominated by a few aristocrats while the masses live as serfs.

The chapter argues that the spirit of '76—the republican ethos of the United States—is currently lost in a wilderness without a clear strategy to reclaim its democratic integrity. It highlights the inefficacy of conventional tactics such as public protests, economic theorizing, and political campaigning when devoid of strategic coherence and focused leadership. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign is examined as a case of potential misdirection, wherein the campaign ended with him endorsing Hillary Clinton, a perceived agent of the plutocracy, rather than advancing his anti-corruption agenda. This act allegedly contributed to the electoral victory of Donald Trump, whom some viewed as an ""insane clown"" preferable to Clinton.

The chapter critiques the systemic nature of plutocratic corruption that has exacerbated economic inequality and authoritarian governance, which require urgent strategic mobilization rather than mere public education. It posits that anger at such inequality predisposes societies to fascist demagoguery. The text underscores the inefficacy of piecemeal reforms proposed by Democratic efforts, such as HR-1, in tackling the comprehensive corruption enabled by influence peddling and systemic infiltration into political processes. Instead, structural reforms are urgently needed, starting with stringent recusal rules to limit campaign financing conflicts within the legislative branch.

Moreover, the chapter critiques the role of mainstream media (MSM) in perpetuating corruption due to its vested interests in political advertising, which diminishes its capability to act as an unbiased watchdog. Campaigns like Bernie Sanders' have historically struggled in media representation due to their challenge to the entrenched system of influence. Consequently, media interests further polarize issues, dismissing corruption as the true priority over other debated topics. 

The text asserts that the crux of democratic reform—the eradication of systemic corruption—is central and could be accomplished through legally enforceable reforms countering judicial supremacy and political influence motivated by self-interest. Reflecting on past failures and recurring strategic omissions on anti-corruption efforts, the chapter warns of the inexorable movement towards totalitarian politics unless substantial and unified approaches are adopted by public entities to dethrone plutocratic dominance and restore democratic praxis.

In summary, the chapter accentuates the urgency for strategic clarity and collective action against the entrenched plutocratic corruption that undermines democratic governance, and calls for substantial systemic change to restore political equality, mitigate economic inequality, and ultimately sustain democracy."
"Chapter 2. The Buy: New Gilded Age Boss Worse than the Old Boss
","Chapter 2 of the book addresses the pervasive issue of systemic political corruption in the United States and its perilous influence on democracy. The chapter begins with references to historical texts that underscore the corrosive impact of money on politics, illustrating how historically, economic power has often translated into political power, thereby undermining democratic principles. The first section, ""Rise and Decline of the First Gilded Age Plutocracy,"" highlights the legacy of American plutocracy, characterized by Lincoln Steffens as a time when Washington was beholden to Wall Street rather than serving the public interest. Senator Richard Franklin Pettigrew's accounts of the Gilded Age reveal how governance was influenced chiefly by corporate interests, setting a precedent for the recurring problem of money in today's politics—the second Gilded Age epitomized by global financial capitalism and empire.

Throughout the chapter, notable historical figures such as Marcus ""Dollar Mark"" Hanna and Theodore Roosevelt are invoked to illustrate the entrenchment of monetary influence in political systems. Hanna's assertion that money is paramount in politics underscores the focus on financial capital's role in shaping policy and governance. This historical narrative is juxtaposed with the Progressive Era reforms and the New Deal, which initially aimed to counteract such corruptive influences and restore democratic integrity, albeit partially and temporarily.

The chapter asserts that socioeconomic inequalities, perpetuated by judicial supremacy and plutocratic control, laid the foundation for both eras of Gilded Age corruption—a contrast to the more equitable eras of progressive reform. It describes how various reforms, including the establishment of the New Deal and state-led progressive initiatives, were ultimately stifled by a resurgence of plutocratic influence, particularly after the anti-communist Cold War era. The landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which legalized significant campaign finance through the lens of constitutional free speech, is posited as a pivotal moment marking the ascent of the Second Gilded Age and the resurgence of plutocracy.

The comparison of economic indices, tax reforms, and income disparities across decades function as quantitative metrics evidencing the systemic inequities inherent in plutocratic rule. These demonstrate escalating income and wealth inequality, the concentration of financial power, and degraded political and economic conditions for the majority of citizens—a trend exacerbated by policies favorable to financial elites. The chapter implies that the economic disenfranchisement of many Americans parallels historical instances of slavery by leveraging terms such as ""precariat"" to describe the socioeconomic plight of the modern working and middle classes.

As the narrative progresses, the chapter considers broader political implications, arguing that meaningful political change and economic reform are unattainable without first addressing the corruption inherent to plutocratic influence. It calls attention to strategic failures, analogous to historical progressive movements, highlighting the need to focus on effective anti-corruption strategy before considering broader socialist or economic policies, particularly emphasizing that socialism is historically misaligned with the realities of American political movements.

In concluding its analysis, the chapter surveys contemporary socio-political dynamics culminating in a dangerous trajectory towards systemic collapse. It warns of the risk posed by entrenched corruption leading to authoritarianism and totalitarianism, suggesting lessons from analogies in historical patterns of Roman and antebellum American political decline. With an examination of modern governance, including the dual threats of income inequality, environmental degradation, and militarized foreign policy, the narrative stresses the pressing need for democratic revival as an antidote to avoid further collapse.

Overall, Chapter 2 paints a detailed picture of the systemic and historical interplay between economic power and political corruption within American democracy, urging a reevaluation and reform of governance systems to stave off ruinous outcomes."
"Chapter 3.  In Search of the Missing Chapter
","Chapter 3, ""In Search of the Missing Chapter,"" primarily addresses the absence of effective progressive strategies to counter systemic corruption and restore democracy in the United States. The chapter criticizes various political analysts, authors, and strategists for their failure to propose comprehensive reforms that address the deep-rooted issue of plutocratic corruption. The text explores historical and contemporary political dynamics, outlining how the U.S. fell into an era of systemic corruption starting from the Buckley v. Valeo decision of 1976, which legalized money in politics.

The chapter delves into the ineffectiveness of various proposals, such as constitutional amendments, piecemeal reforms, and single-issue activism that often fail to address the systemic decay of democratic institutions. The author critiques popular narratives and strategies typically put forth by well-known intellectuals and organizations, arguing that these approaches often misunderstand or misrepresent the structural nature of the corruption that permeates the U.S. political system.

The literature reviewed in the chapter reveals a consistent pattern: although many authors and thinkers accurately diagnose symptoms of the larger corruption problem, they often fall short in prescribing viable solutions. The chapter suggests that professional activists and commentators have been more focused on marketable strategies and fundraising rather than developing effective, cohesive movements capable of confronting plutocratic power.

It further examines historical examples, such as the Whig and Progressive movements, and argues that significant systemic reform is required rather than tactical or ideological compromises. The author calls for a unified strategy that prioritizes the elimination of systemic corruption, emphasizing that successful movements must challenge the entrenched powers of the Supreme Court and the political establishment. By addressing systemic corruption robustly rather than focusing on its symptoms, the author argues that real democratic change can be achieved, concluding that political innovation and new strategies are essential for a meaningful transformation in American politics."
"Chapter 4.  Citizens United
","Chapter 4, titled ""Citizens United,"" offers a critical examination of the systemic corruption in the United States stemming from the influence of corporate money in politics, specifically highlighting the landmark Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. This 2010 ruling permitted unlimited corporate electioneering expenditures, a decision that the chapter argues has been mistaken for the root cause of political corruption. However, the author suggests that the decision itself has been overemphasized compared to other more impactful factors that perpetuate political corruption.

H.L. Mencken's quote, ""For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong,"" serves as a warning against simplistic fixes to deep-rooted issues like political corruption. The chapter explores the inadequacy of focusing solely on overturning Citizens United, asserting that such soundbite solutions divert attention from more substantial systemic problems. The author traces the origins of political corruption to earlier decisions, notably Buckley v. Valeo, which equated money with speech, thus enabling vast political influence through financial means. Furthermore, Speechnow.org v. FEC, rather than Citizens United, is identified as the pivotal case that legalized unlimited independent political investments, giving rise to SuperPACs.

The chapter delves into the misapprehensions surrounding Citizens United's impact. It critiques the professional activists' strategy that misidentifies corporate personhood as a culprit, arguing that ""corporate personhood"" had little to do with Citizens United. Historically, the doctrine of corporate personhood, related primarily to property rights, was largely neutralized with the New Deal's judicial revolution in 1937, which overturned the Supreme Court's plutocrat-favoring doctrines of the Lochner era. The chapter emphasizes that the resurgence of plutocratic influence is rooted in corrupt judicial supremacy, not corporate personhood.

Through a detailed critique, the chapter laments the soundbite-driven activist strategies that misleadingly advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, asserting this as a diversion from effective systemic reform. The author highlights that such strategies, driven by marketing rather than substantive change, risk further entrenching plutocratic power by failing to address the broader issues of money in politics. The proposed focus on corporate electioneering is deemed inadequate as it overlooks the multifaceted nature of political corruption, which stems from both corporate and non-corporate sources.

The author argues for a political response rooted in restoring checks and balances to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, utilizing legislative powers provided by Article III of the Constitution as a more attainable and effective method than constitutional amendment. This approach aims to restore legislative authority over campaign finance while resisting the judicial overreach seen in Citizens United. Overall, the chapter presents a nuanced critique of the prevailing activist narrative and calls for strategic reforms that address the true nature and scope of political corruption beyond the soundbite solutions."
"Chapter 5.  Burdensome Piggyback: the Amendment Con
","Chapter 5 of the book ""Strategies for Democracy"" critically examines the idea of using constitutional amendments to address issues of corporate rights and money in politics. The chapter argues against the notion that redefining corporate personhood through an amendment would effectively curtail corporate influence in politics. It suggests that such amendments are superficial, difficult to enact, and may lead to unintended consequences.

The chapter draws historical comparisons, noting that past leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt successfully challenged judicial supremacy without amendments, primarily by mobilizing public opinion and asserting legislative authority. Lincoln, for example, opposed the Dred Scott decision not by proposing an amendment but by questioning its legitimacy and championing presidential authority.

The chapter outlines five major drawbacks to relying on constitutional amendments to fix judicial supremacy: the difficulty in drafting effective amendments, the intolerable delays associated with the amendment process, the risk of judicial interpretation undermining amendments, the fault lying not within the Constitution but in judicial misinterpretation, and the need for empowering people to influence judicial decisions beyond constitutional amendments.

The concept of judicial supremacy, historically originating from the antebellum Slave Power oligarchy, is identified as a significant barrier to reform. Judicial supremacy, the chapter posits, was initiated by Chief Justice Taney in Dred Scott, serving slaveholders' interests by stretching interpretation beyond original constitutional confines. The current judicial supremacy challenges mirror historical abuses but with plutocratic underpinnings, emphasizing the urgency for strategic legislative and public action.

Finally, the chapter makes the case that real political reform requires direct legislative action rather than constitutional amendments. It advocates stripping the court's jurisdiction in specific areas, targeting corrupt judicial figures, and mobilizing public support against judicial overreach as practical solutions to regaining democratic control. The approach stresses educating public opinion and uniting efforts around comprehensive legislative measures rather than divided and ineffective amendment strategies."
"Chapter 6.  Learning from Experience: 
 
  The Amendment Drought
","Chapter 6, ""Learning from Experience: The Amendment Drought,"" provides an in-depth analysis of how constitutional amendment efforts have been stymied in the United States due to the influence of money in politics, particularly following the Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo, which legalized money in politics. The focal point of the chapter is the contemporary struggle to amend the Constitution amidst the challenges posed by this ""New Gilded Age.""

The chapter begins with an important observation by Professor Bruce Ackerman about the futility of pursuing constitutional amendments through Article Five. Instead, he suggests focusing on creating landmark statutes and judicial superprecedents. Historically, two significant amendment efforts— the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and the D.C. voting rights amendment—failed ratification despite possessing substantial merit.

The ERA, a major initiative that aimed to guarantee equal rights for women, symbolized a broader movement for gender equality fueled by the successes of the civil rights movement. Though it received significant congressional support in 1972, opposition from the ""New Right,"" a coalition spearheaded by jurisdictions heavily influenced by religious and misogynistic interests, prevented its ratification. This coalition was fortified through funding enabled by the Buckley decision. Despite a shifting societal and political landscape that showed overwhelming public support for gender equality, the ERA remained elusive due to lingering opposition entrenched in the intersections of race, misogyny, and nativism.

Similarly, the D.C. voting rights amendment sought to address the disenfranchisement of the District's residents due to its unique legal status. In the evolving urban environment, denying D.C. residents representation contradicted democratic principles. Unfortunately, this amendment faced similar obstacles, likely due to racial and partisan interests that saw D.C. statehood as a threat to existing political dynamics, particularly because of its predominantly Democratic voter base.

These amendment failures demonstrate the immense challenges for constitutional reform. They highlight the systemic role of financial and ideological alliances in inhibiting such efforts. Importantly, these struggles echo Professor Ackerman's assertion that attempts at constitutional amendments in the present age, characterized by oligarchic influences, are futile.

The text further explores how the complexities of drafting amendments, particularly to curb money in politics post-Citizens United, exceed the clarity of the ERA, complicating their potential success. It critiques the tendency of activist organizations to simplify amendment efforts into marketable slogans rather than engaging in pragmatic, actionable strategies. Such approaches prioritize organizational survival and fundraising over achieving genuine political reform.

Conclusively, the chapter surmises that achieving progressive change necessitates legislative successes that can diminish the corrupting influence of money wholesale, rather than relying on hard-to-materialize constitutional amendments. Amidst current political dynamics, seeking amendments appears a ""road to nowhere,"" with plutocracy's grip reinforced through judicial interpretations that subvert democratic principles."
"Chapter 7.   Amendment Diversion and Opportunity Cost
","Chapter 7 of the book on strategies for democracy delves into the concept of ""Amendment Diversion and Opportunity Cost,"" advocating for more effective approaches to combat systemic corruption in U.S. politics rather than pursuing constitutional amendments. The chapter begins by highlighting how the entrenched system of money in politics resembles the technological complexities described in the Collingridge dilemma, where regulation becomes increasingly difficult over time. As plutocratic corruption grows, those benefiting from it gain power, while opposition weakens, sidelining progressives and fostering a sense that plutocracy is preferable to totalitarianism.

The Democratic Party's response to the Citizens United decision exemplifies the ineffectiveness of pursuing constitutional amendments as a sole solution. This approach, termed “Amendment Diversion,” is critiqued as a strategic blunder that consumes time and political capital without yielding results. Proponents like Senator Tom Udall argue that a constitutional amendment is necessary to restore election integrity, despite its infeasibility given the historical difficulty of passing such amendments. Instead, the chapter suggests focusing on legislative actions that could apply conflict of interest recusal requirements to campaign financing—a simpler and more attainable reform that could be enforced more effectively.

The narrative discusses the opportunity missed by Democrats in 2012 when a simpler majority vote could have enacted more effective changes in Senate ethical rules surrounding campaign finance, emphasizing this as a more practical approach compared to the arduous process of constitutional amendments. It critiques the false dichotomy presented by politicians like Udall, who claim amendments are the only solution, despite evidence to the contrary from scholars suggesting easier legislative paths.

Furthermore, the chapter examines the inherent flaws in relying solely on the constitutional amendment process, which risks delays and unintended consequences, arguing that comprehensive legislation is more straightforward and immediate upon enactment.

On judicial supremacy and First Amendment issues, the chapter critiques the Supreme Court's decisions in cases like Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United, which have misinterpreted and distorted the First Amendment to equate money with speech, thereby legalizing corruption. The Court's overreach into legislative powers is highlighted as a significant constitutional violation, undermining both separation of powers and federalism.

The chapter posits that legislative solutions harnessing existing constitutional principles like separation of powers and states' rights could more effectively curb judicial overreach and systemic corruption. Such strategies would engage public opinion, historically the real source of First Amendment content, while respecting the Constitution's original design for divided powers and self-governance.

Lastly, the chapter underscores that the public generally rejects the idea that money equates to speech, challenging the Supreme Court’s interpretation. It advocates for a strategy targeting the malpractice of specific justices rather than altering the Constitution, emphasizing broad popular support for legislative remedies over ineffective amendment pursuits. This approach, according to the chapter, would better align with the public’s intuitive understanding of the Constitution and its democratic principles."
"Chapter 8.  Failed Strategy:  Judicial Appointments
","Chapter 8 of the book concentrates on the failed strategy of judicial appointments in the pursuit of democratic reform. The text critically evaluates former President Obama’s approach to the Citizens United decision and suggests that his advocacy for a constitutional amendment process was more of a political diversion than a genuine strategic effort to implement change. It argues that Obama, despite understanding the nominal impact of Citizens United on SuperPACs, misdirected public discourse towards a feeble amendment process instead of applying pressure directly to areas that could effectively counteract plutocratic influence.

The chapter further critiques the strategies of professional activists and organizations, asserting that their focus is often misguided and serves to perpetuate the status quo. It discusses the inefficacy of professional activism, which prioritizes fundraising over strategic efficacy, leading to wasted resources and the reinforcement of the plutocratic structure they claim to oppose. Examples such as Greenpeace and other environmental movements illustrate how activist organizations can become more aligned with corporate interests than with genuine reform.

Judicial appointments also come under scrutiny in the chapter, particularly focusing on Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court and the broader implications of such appointments. Garland's nomination, and the support he received from various liberal factions, is characterized as an endorsement that contradicts their purported goals to oppose plutocracy. The text highlights Garland’s judicial record, most notably his role in the Speechnow.org decision, as evidence of his alignment with plutocratic interests. This critique extends to the broader professional activist community, which accepted and supported Garland without adequately questioning his stance or credentials regarding plutocratic issues.

In essence, the chapter posits that existing strategies, including those involving judicial appointments, are insufficient to combat systemic corruption. The text underscores the need for new leaders and strategies, advocating for a departure from fragmented, siloed efforts towards a cohesive movement focused on effective strategic planning. It calls for activism that prioritizes genuine democratic reform over mere political survival or profit motives, highlighting the imperative for a comprehensive reevaluation of approaches to overcome the entrenched plutocratic influence in American democracy."
"Chapter 9.  The Lessons of Seven Amendments
","Chapter 9 of the book delves into the concept of using constitutional amendments as a strategy to overturn Supreme Court decisions deemed undesirable or egregious, specifically focusing on the Citizens United ruling. The chapter scrutinizes the prevalent notion that amendments are the sole means to rectify such decisions and critiques the fraudulent ""only way"" argument propagated by some advocates. It highlights the inefficacy of attempts to garner state legislature resolutions pushing for constitutional amendments, deeming them a mere façade of progress.

The chapter critically examines seven historical amendments often cited by advocates as precedents for overturning Supreme Court rulings. These amendments include the 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 19th, 24th, and 26th. The argument proposes that none of these amendments served the purpose of overturning decisions similar to Citizens United because they either addressed federalism issues, were politically expedient but counterproductive, or were aimed at broader societal reforms rather than directly countering Supreme Court rulings.

A detailed discussion is provided about four specific amendments (13th, 14th, 19th, and 26th) and how they were designed to reduce state powers instead of overturning judicial supremacy. The 16th and 24th Amendments exemplify how amendments have historically been used as political diversions, serving more as symbolic gestures or strategic delays rather than genuine solutions to judicial usurpations.

The chapter argues that the 11th Amendment is the closest analogy to what would be needed to overturn Citizens United, as it addressed a specific Supreme Court overreach by directly stripping judicial power. However, it underscores that even this amendment was subject to judicial interpretation that diluted its intended effect, cautioning against the reliability of using amendments to curb Supreme Court authority effectively.

Overall, the chapter asserts that legislative action under the Exceptions Clause is a more practical and effective method for resolving issues like those posed by Citizens United. It proposes that constitutional amendments, particularly those aiming to overturn Supreme Court decisions, are futile and potentially dangerous, as they may lead to unintended consequences given the Supreme Court's history of broad interpretations."
"Chapter 10.  Swing-issue Voting
","Chapter 10, titled ""Swing-issue Voting,"" delves into the strategic use of swing-issue voting as a means to enact progressive change within an electoral system dominated by systemic corruption. The chapter begins by highlighting the inherent challenges faced by progressives, who comprise about 20% of the electorate, in simultaneously winning on multiple issues due to the divisive nature of identity politics and siloed activism. However, the chapter argues that progressives can leverage their numbers to swing elections by focusing on a single, unifying issue: anti-corruption reform, which serves as the strategic focal point capable of dismantling the entrenched plutocracy that blocks majoritarian reforms.

The chapter provides a historical overview, with examples such as the Five Star Movement in Italy, illustrating how digital democracy can facilitate a grassroots movement that prioritizes ideas and projects over traditional party structures. It emphasizes the importance of adopting a leaderless model to prevent the concentration of power and ensure transparency and democratic accountability within the movement.

Progressives are urged to learn from past strategic failures, where ineffective and counterproductive strategies have been peddled by professional activists and opinion makers. Strategies like constitutional amendments, professional activism, and the reliance on charismatic figureheads without a coherent strategy are criticized for their inability to effect real change. The chapter advocates for a shift towards Swing Issue Voting (SIV), focusing solely on systemic anti-corruption reform that can sustain itself and lead to further democratic reforms across various policy areas.

The narrative explains that this strategy requires organizing progressive voters to become independent swing voters willing to pledge their votes for any party or politician that delivers the chosen reform before the next election. This approach demands strict avoidance of unrelated issues and alliances while ensuring unity among voters. SIV necessitates an informed choice of priority reform, efficient unity around the strategy, tabulating pledges, and possibly supporting tools for information dissemination.

A thought experiment is presented to illustrate the potential impact of swing-issue voting, using the 2012 election of President Barack Obama as a case study. The experiment demonstrates how mobilizing a small percentage of voters around a single swing issue could have changed the election's outcome, encouraging voters to use their vote strategically to achieve anti-corruption reform rather than settling for the lesser of two evils. The narrative explores how digital tools can assist in organizing such a movement independently from traditional party frameworks.

Ultimately, the chapter contends that strategic voting focused on addressing systemic corruption will not only restore democracy but also enable the achievement of progressive and majoritarian policy goals across other issue areas. The proposed strategy is framed as the only sustainable path to overcoming the current political stagnation and achieving meaningful reform."
"Chapter 11.  Framing a swing issue
","Chapter 11 delves into the strategic maneuvering required to address the pervasive issue of political corruption within democratic systems. The central focus is on the swing-issue voting (SIV) strategy, which empowers a minority of voters to compel politicians to enact legislation that counters systemic corruption, offering a potentially more effective alternative to constitutional amendments.

Legislation presents several strategic advantages over constitutional amendments, primarily because it allows for clearer definitions and control over jurisdictional boundaries, particularly concerning the Supreme Court's role in political questions. This legislative approach offers Congress a more direct means to influence separation of powers issues, circumventing judicial impositions and restoring balance as championed by historically significant presidents and leaders.

A key aspect discussed is the historical precedent of the successful use of legislation to overthrow unfavorable Supreme Court rulings, exemplified by actions taken by figures like Lincoln and FDR. The chapter critiques the constitutional amendment process's insufficiency in resolving federal versus state power disputes, citing past dilatory amendments and judicial resistance as obstacles to swift reform.

Further, the chapter outlines the problematic entrenchment of judicial supremacy, where unelected Supreme Court justices impose plutocratic rule, subverting democratic principles. The narrative underscores the necessity of legislative remedies that bypass state involvement in amendment ratification processes, especially concerning separation of powers violations aimed at curbing political corruption.

The discussion introduces the potent legal tool of stripping appellate jurisdiction from the Supreme Court—a practice well-established and more consistently adhered to than constitutional amendment processes—to ensure that state's rights and political integrity laws are shielded from judicial overreach.

The analysis extends to consider the Thirteenth Amendment's scope, arguing its potential application beyond its conventional interpretation related to racial slavery. It posits that the amendment, rooted in broader republican ideals, should encompass resistance to all forms of oligarchic and plutocratic oppression, aligning with historical understandings of slavery as defined by the nation's founders.

The narrative suggests that legislative bodies, not courts, should wield the authority to interpret such constitutional abstractions as 'slavery,' following the ethos of representative governance. It criticizes the Supreme Court's historical role in reinforcing plutocracy under the guise of constitutional interpretation, calling for active engagement from citizens and their representatives to reclaim democratic rights.

In conclusion, the chapter presents a roadmap for leveraging the interplay between federal and state powers, bolstered by congressional action, to dismantle the judicially sanctioned plutocratic corruption. It advocates for an assertive reclaiming of the democratic process, targeting judicial supremacy and reinforcing states' sovereign rights to uphold election integrity without undue interference from the Supreme Court."
"Chapter 12  A Simple 
 
 Litmus Test
","Chapter 12 of the book on strategies for democracy presents an innovative approach to counter plutocratic corruption through a state-centric legislative strategy. The author posits that a streamlined and bipartisan-supported litmus test can catalyze significant federal anti-corruption reform. Drawing on historical perspectives, the chapter underscores the necessity for a coherent, state-level initiative that challenges the Supreme Court’s inhibitive jurisprudence on political corruption and empowers states to regain their democratic sovereignty.

The chapter advocates for leveraging ""states' rights"" to initiate systemic reform, spotlighting the inconsistency in Republican opposition to voting rights under the guise of states' rights. It critiques the inefficacy of piecemeal reforms such as those proposed in HR 1, arguing that such strategies often serve as fundraising ploys rather than substantive solutions. Instead, the author introduces the ""Eleventh Amendment Enforcement Act,"" aiming to strip the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over state anti-corruption laws and restore the validity of previously overturned legislation.

Moreover, the narrative emphasizes the importance of employing insurgent politics and strategic voter organization to disrupt the entrenched duopoly and corrupt practices within the political system. It highlights the historical example of the South's swing issue voting strategy as a model for achieving cohesive political influence, urging progressives to adopt a similarly unified approach against corruption.

Finally, the chapter critiques the current political landscape, where progressives are dispersed among various non-strategic concerns while Republicans are misled by divisive rhetoric, emphasizing that successful anti-corruption efforts require competent strategy, direct legislative action, and collaborative state-federal initiatives to effectively restore integrity and democratic principles to the electoral process."
